Key Features:
1. Graphical User Interface: The game features an intuitive and user-friendly GUI developed using Java Swing components. Players can easily interact with the game through buttons and visual feedback.

2. Two Player Mode: The game supports two-player mode, enabling two individuals to play against each other on the same computer. Each player takes turns placing their respective symbols (X or O) on the grid.

3. Grid-Based Board: The game board is represented as a grid with 3 rows and 3 columns, providing a familiar TicTacToe layout for players to strategize and compete.

4. Timer for Each Player: A timer is implemented for each player to add a sense of urgency and excitement to the gameplay. Players have a limited time to make their move before their turn ends.

5. Win Detection: The game includes logic to detect winning combinations on the board, such as three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. When a player achieves a winning combination, the game announces the winner and ends the current round.

6. Draw Detection: If no player achieves a winning combination and the board is filled with symbols, the game declares a draw, indicating that neither player has won the round.

7. Reset and Restart Options: Players have the option to reset the current game board to start a new round or restart the entire game to play again from the beginning.

8. Visual Feedback and Alerts: The game provides visual feedback and alerts to inform players of important events, such as invalid moves, game outcomes (win/draw), and timer expiration.

9. Error Handling: The application includes error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected inputs or runtime errors gracefully, ensuring a smooth and error-free gaming experience.

10. Customization Options: Future enhancements may include options for players to customize game settings, such as choosing their preferred symbols, adjusting timer durations, or selecting different themes for the GUI.

Overall, the GUI-based Two Player TicTacToe Game with Timer Using Java Swing offers a fun and engaging way for players to enjoy the classic TicTacToe experience while showcasing the capabilities of Java Swing for building interactive graphical applications.
